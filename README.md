MCGalaxy is a fully featured and customisable **ClassiCube Server Software** based on MCForge/MCLawl.

**Setup**
-----------------
Download the latest MCGalaxy release [from here](https://github.com/UnknownShadow200/MCGalaxy/releases)
* Windows: You need to install .NET framework 4.0. Windows 8/10 already have this included.
* Linux/macOS: You need to install the [Mono framework](https://www.mono-project.com).

Run **MCGalaxy.exe** for a graphical interface, or run **MCGalaxyCLI.exe** for command line only.

Joining your server
-----------------
Run MCGalaxy.exe or MCGalaxyCLI.exe firstly. You'll see something like:

If you are signed in to classicube.net, you can copy this URL straight into your web browser and start playing.

#### Joining from the desktop client
Click **Direct connect** at the main menu.

#### Make yourself owner
After joining, you will want to rank yourself owner so you can use all commands.

Type ```/rank [your account] superop``` into the bottom text box, then press Enter.

Letting others join your server
-----------------
#### LAN players
You need to find out your LAN/local IP address.
*  Windows: Type ```ipconfig``` into **Command Prompt**. Look for ```IPv4 address``` in the output.

To join from a web browser, add ```?ip=[lan ip]``` to the server's URL.\
(e.g. http://www.classicube.net/server/play/d1362e7fee1a54365514712d007c8799?ip=192.168.1.30)

To join from the desktop client, **Direct connect** to ```[lan ip]:25565``` instead. (e.g. ```192.168.1.30:25565```)


#### Across the internet
You need to port forward your router. Players can then join by entering the server URL into their web browser.

For the desktop client:
* Click **Sign in**. 
* Type/paste the hash (e.g. ```d1362e7fee1a54365514712d007c8799```) into the *classicube.net/server/play* text box. 
* Click **Connect**.


#### Show on classicube.net server list
Click **Settings** in the MCGalaxy window, then tick the **Public** checkbox. Then click **Save**.

This makes your server appear in the server list on classicube.net and in the desktop client.
