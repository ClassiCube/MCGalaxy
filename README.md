About MCGalaxy Classic

Contributors
------------

* If you are pushing your commits OR if you are doing a pull request, PLEASE make sure to NORMALIZE your entire local repo if it isn't already normalized. The head repo is already normalized, so if you forked or pulled from the HEAD, everything should be alright. See [this link][4] for more info on re-normalizing your repo.  
**!NOTE!** Commits that do not handle the line-endings correctly *WILL* be reverted.  
  
* Do not commit large blocks of changes and files. Try to split and group these into smaller related pieces and commit these one by one. If you are adding a new file that might have 100+ lines of code additions, then that's allowed, just don't add anything else unrelated to that commit!
  
* Please make sure you fetch and merge the latest commits into your local branch before pushing any commits where you might have changed files that would cause a conflict. This does **NOT** mean that you have to fetch and merge with *every* commitment or push. Just keep track of the latest commitments and see if someone else might have changed a file you've been working on.  
A good habbit would be to *first* make some couple of commitments, then BEFORE pushing, do a fetch/merge and fix any conflicts (if there are any).
