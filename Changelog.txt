- Fix a critical bug with leaving a level as the only player and then rejoining
  the level would result in you being re-added to the level which was then unloaded
  due to the BlockDB not having finished saving before you rejoined,
  thus causing draw commands to not work and block updates to not be saved.

- Removed /scinema and /pcinema.
- Fix /ignore not properly persisting between sessions.
- Added noise generator for new levels. (thanks megalomaniactom)

  for drawing commands, physics undo max entries)
