Looking for the files to run MCGalaxy? 
You probably want to go to the Releases page and get the latest zip from there.

However, you can still download the required files from here. You need these files:
MCGalaxy.exe, MCGalaxy.CLI, MCGalaxy_.dll

--
MCGalaxy_ infid.dll is a special version of MCGalaxy which increases maximum id in /gb and /lb from 255 to 767.
Replace MCGalaxy_.dll with this file (i.e. rename it to MCGalaxy_.dll) to use it.

You probably don't want this version though, because it slightly reduces performance.
